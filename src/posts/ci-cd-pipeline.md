# Building a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are essential practices for modern software development. In this post, we'll set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically building and testing code changes.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically deploying code to production after passing tests.

## Why GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool built into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code.

## Example Workflow

Here's a basic workflow for a Node.js app:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

## Conclusion

With GitHub Actions, you can automate your entire development workflow, from code review to deployment. In future posts, we'll explore advanced workflows and deployment strategies.
